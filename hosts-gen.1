.SH NAME
hosts-gen \- generate /etc/hosts from /etc/hosts.d

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hosts-gen

.SH DESCRIPTION
This  is a simple framework to create your hosts file from many files in
a hosts.d folder. It is usefull especially when you  have  a  frequently
updated  part  of  the  hosts  file,  like a filter list for spam and it
should be integrated into the main hosts file without any manual
intervention.

The  hosts  parts are by default stored in /etc/hosts.d and will be read
according to their standard sort order in ls(1). The file names have the
form  of ’^[0‐9]*‐[^ ]’ (see the etc/hosts.d dir for the standard header
and the localhost). Files can be easily excluded from being run  by
removing the numbers in front of their name.
